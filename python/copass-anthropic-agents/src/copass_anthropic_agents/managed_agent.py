"""CopassManagedAgent — Copass-aware Anthropic Managed Agents subclass.

Bundles a :class:`ManagedAgentBackend` with two Copass-specific
behaviors toggled on when you pass a :class:`CopassClient` + sandbox
(+ optional window):

1. **Discover-as-step-1.** On the first turn of a new session, the
   agent calls ``client.retrieval.discover`` with the incoming user
   message as the query and prepends a structured context block to
   the user's first turn. Claude sees relevant sandbox signal without
   having to decide to call ``discover`` itself. Safe across
   continuation sessions: when
   ``context.handles[SESSION_ID_HANDLE]`` is populated we skip
   injection — Anthropic's session already holds the prior turns.

2. **Automatic turn capture.** When ``window`` is passed, a
   :class:`CopassTurnRecorder` mirrors user + assistant turns into
   the Context Window so retrieval across future calls is
   window-aware.

Both are cache-safe: they operate at the message layer (user events)
and the stream layer (post-response events), never touching
``system_prompt`` or the tool catalog — so
:class:`ManagedAgentBackend`'s managed-agent fingerprint cache keeps
hitting and Anthropic's 60-creates/min rate limit is never stressed.

Disable either with ``prefetch_discover=False`` / ``auto_record=False``.
When neither :attr:`copass_client` nor :attr:`window` is set, this
class behaves identically to a plain ``BaseAgent`` over
:class:`ManagedAgentBackend`.

Example::

    copass = CopassClient(auth=ApiKeyAuth(key=os.environ["COPASS_API_KEY"]))
    window = await copass.context_window.create(sandbox_id=sandbox_id)

    agent = CopassManagedAgent(
        identity="support",
        system_prompt="You are a support agent.",
        anthropic_api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"],
        copass_client=copass,
        sandbox_id=sandbox_id,
        window=window,
    )
    result = await agent.run(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "why is checkout flaky?"}],
        context=AgentInvocationContext(scope=AgentScope(user_id="u-1")),
    )

class CopassManagedAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Anthropic-Managed-Agents subclass of :class:`BaseAgent` with
    Copass context-engineering baked in.

    Args:
        identity: Stable identifier (logs, managed-agent resource
            naming). Required.
        system_prompt: System prompt. Required. Stable across turns —
            no interpolation happens against it. Leave placeholders
            like ``{{copass_context}}`` OUT; the Copass layer injects
            context via a message-level prefix, not by mutating the
            system prompt.
        model: Anthropic model id. Defaults to ``claude-sonnet-4-6``.
        anthropic_api_key: Passed through to the Anthropic SDK. If
            omitted, the SDK reads ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` from env.
        anthropic_client: Pre-built ``AsyncAnthropic`` client. Takes
            precedence over ``anthropic_api_key``.
        tools: Static :class:`AgentToolRegistry`. May be omitted if
            ``tool_resolver`` is provided.
        tool_resolver: Dynamic resolver for per-invocation
            scope-bound tools.
        on_conflict: Conflict policy for static + dynamic tool
            collisions. See :class:`BaseAgent`.
        copass_client: An authenticated :class:`CopassClient`. Required
            to enable ``prefetch_discover``.
        sandbox_id: Sandbox to retrieve / record against. Required to
            enable ``prefetch_discover`` or ``auto_record``.
        window: Optional :class:`ContextWindow`. Required to enable
            ``auto_record``; passed through to ``prefetch_discover``
            so the injected context respects conversation history
            when ``window`` has seeded turns.
        prefetch_discover: Inject a discover context block on the
            first user turn of each new session. Default True;
            silently no-ops when ``copass_client`` or ``sandbox_id``
            is missing.
        auto_record: Mirror user + assistant turns into ``window``.
            Default True; silently no-ops when ``window`` is missing.
        author: Optional provenance identifier (e.g.
            ``"agent:support-bot"``) attached to assistant turns and
            ingested content. Enables
            :class:`CopassTurnRecorder.include_author_prefix` under
            the hood.
        project_id: Optional project scoping passed to
            ``client.retrieval.discover`` during prefetch.
