"""CopassGoogleAgent — Copass-aware Vertex AI Agent Engine subclass.

Bundles a :class:`GoogleAgentBackend` with two Copass-specific
behaviors toggled on when you pass a :class:`CopassClient` + sandbox
(+ optional window):

1. **Discover-as-step-1.** On the first turn of a new session, the
   agent calls ``client.retrieval.discover`` with the incoming user
   message as the query and prepends a structured context block to
   the user's first turn. Gemini sees relevant sandbox signal without
   having to decide to call ``discover`` itself through the
   server-side ``copass_dispatch`` proxy. Continuation sessions
   (where ``context.handles[SESSION_ID_HANDLE]`` is populated) skip
   injection — the ADK session already holds the prior turns.

2. **Automatic turn capture.** When ``window`` is passed, a
   :class:`CopassTurnRecorder` mirrors user + assistant turns into
   the Context Window so retrieval across future calls is
   window-aware.

Google-specific shape note:

    ADK's ``async_stream_query`` takes a single string message, not
    a list. So the prepended synthetic user message gets concatenated
    into the real user message by
    :meth:`GoogleAgentBackend._normalize_messages` (join with
    ``"\\n\\n"``). Gemini sees a single user turn that begins with
    the ``<copass_context>`` block and ends with the user's real
    question. This is the structural equivalent of the separate
    ``user.message`` events Anthropic Managed Agents receives.

    Tools are still dispatched server-side via the
    ``copass_dispatch`` proxy baked into the deployed reasoning
    engine — :class:`CopassGoogleAgent` does NOT send tool specs
    per-turn. The discover / interpret / search / ingest tools from
    :mod:`copass_google_agents.retrieval_tools` and
    :mod:`copass_google_agents.ingest_tool` are reachable through
    that proxy when the server-side :class:`AgentToolResolver`
    registers them.

Disable either feature with ``prefetch_discover=False`` /
``auto_record=False``. When neither :attr:`copass_client` nor
:attr:`window` is set, this class behaves identically to a plain
``BaseAgent`` over :class:`GoogleAgentBackend`.

Example::

    copass = CopassClient(auth=ApiKeyAuth(key=os.environ["COPASS_API_KEY"]))
    window = await copass.context_window.create(sandbox_id=sandbox_id)

    agent = CopassGoogleAgent(
        identity="support",
        system_prompt="You are a support agent.",
        project="my-gcp-project",
        reasoning_engine_id="1234567890",
        copass_client=copass,
        sandbox_id=sandbox_id,
        window=window,
    )
    result = await agent.run(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "why is checkout flaky?"}],
        context=AgentInvocationContext(scope=AgentScope(user_id="u-1")),
    )

**Preview contract caveat:** Google's preview model IDs can be

3.x graduates to GA and the ``-preview`` suffix is dropped.

**Decorative at the runtime layer** — Agent Engine agents are

class CopassGoogleAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Vertex AI Agent Engine subclass of :class:`BaseAgent` with
    Copass context-engineering baked in.

    Args:
        identity: Stable identifier (logs, session titles). Required.
        system_prompt: System prompt. Required. Used at deploy time
            when the ADK agent is first created; not re-applied
            per-turn. Stable — no interpolation happens against it.
            Leave placeholders like ``{{copass_context}}`` OUT; the
            Copass layer injects context via a message-level prefix,
            not by mutating the system prompt.
        project: GCP project id of the deployed reasoning engine.
            Required.
        reasoning_engine_id: Short id of the deployed ADK agent
            resource. Required.
        location: GCP region. Defaults to ``us-central1``.
        model: Gemini model id. See :data:`DEFAULT_MODEL` —
            decorative at runtime; the deployed agent's baked-in
            model wins.
        credentials: Optional pre-resolved
            ``google.auth.credentials.Credentials``. When omitted,
            Application Default Credentials (ADC) are used.
        tools: Static :class:`AgentToolRegistry` for client-side
            tools. Defaults to an empty registry since Google agents
            run tools server-side via the ``copass_dispatch`` proxy.
        tool_resolver: Dynamic resolver for per-invocation
            scope-bound tools. Rarely needed for Google agents.
        on_conflict: Conflict policy for static + dynamic tool
            collisions. See :class:`BaseAgent`.
        copass_client: An authenticated :class:`CopassClient`.
            Required to enable ``prefetch_discover``.
        sandbox_id: Sandbox to retrieve / record against. Required
            to enable ``prefetch_discover`` or ``auto_record``.
        window: Optional :class:`ContextWindow`. Required to enable
            ``auto_record``; passed through to ``prefetch_discover``
            so the injected context respects conversation history
            when ``window`` has seeded turns.
        prefetch_discover: Inject a discover context block on the
            first user turn of each new session. Default True;
            silently no-ops when ``copass_client`` or ``sandbox_id``
            is missing.
        auto_record: Mirror user + assistant turns into ``window``.
            Default True; silently no-ops when ``window`` is missing.
        author: Optional provenance identifier (e.g.
            ``"agent:support-bot"``) attached to assistant turns and
            ingested content. Enables
            :class:`CopassTurnRecorder.include_author_prefix` under
            the hood.
        project_id: Optional project scoping passed to
            ``client.retrieval.discover`` during prefetch. Unified
            with ``window.project_id`` at construction — the two must
            agree (or one must be unset) so discover scoping and
            window ingest scoping target the same project.
