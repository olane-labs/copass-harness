## [0.3.0](https://github.com/olane-labs/copass-harness/compare/@copass/mcp@0.2.8...@copass/mcp@0.3.0) (2026-04-25)

### Features

* **embed:** export `registerRetrievalTools`, `registerContextWindowTools`, `registerIngestTool` so host processes can compose tool groups onto an existing `McpServer` instead of always going through `buildServer()`. Lets a parent MCP server (e.g. the Copass CLI) layer the SDK retrieval surface in without inheriting the SDK ingest tool when it owns its own
* **config:** `ServerConfig.api_key` is now optional in the static type. The standalone `copass-mcp` bin still requires `COPASS_API_KEY` at runtime via `loadConfig()`; embedded callers that pass their own `CopassClient` to `buildServer({ client })` no longer need to supply one
