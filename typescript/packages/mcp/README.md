# @copass/mcp

**Standalone MCP server for [Copass](https://copass.id).** Exposes retrieval + Context Window as MCP tools for any client — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Agent SDK, or your own.

## Prerequisites

Install the Copass CLI and bootstrap your account:

```bash
npm install -g @copass/cli
copass login                             # email OTP
copass setup                             # creates a sandbox, writes .olane/refs.json
copass apikey create --name my-mcp       # prints an olk_... key — shown once, save it
```

Two values feed the MCP server config:

| Output | Use as |
|---|---|
| `olk_...` key printed by `copass apikey create` | `COPASS_API_KEY` |
| `sandbox_id` in `./.olane/refs.json` | `COPASS_SANDBOX_ID` |

Ingest some content so the tools have something to return:

```bash
copass ingest path/to/file.md
```

## Connect your MCP client

Drop this into your client's MCP config, pasting the two values from the previous step:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "copass": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@copass/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "COPASS_API_KEY": "olk_your_api_key",
        "COPASS_SANDBOX_ID": "sb_your_sandbox_id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Config locations:

| Client | Config file |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude.json` (per-user) or `./.mcp.json` (per-project) |
| Claude Desktop | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Claude Agent SDK | Whatever your SDK app loads |

Restart the client after editing. If you see `copass` in the tool picker, you're live.

## Verify

Ask Claude "what tools do you have from copass?" — it should list `discover`, `interpret`, `search`, `context_window_create`, `context_window_add_turn`, `context_window_attach`, `context_window_close`, `ingest`.

Then try: *"Use `context_window_create` and then discover anything about checkout retry behavior."* If retrieval returns something, you're end-to-end.

## Tools

**Retrieval:**
- `discover` — ranked menu of relevant context
- `interpret` — brief pinned to picked items
- `search` — full synthesized answer

**Context Window** — persistent, window-aware memory across turns:
- `context_window_create` — open a new window (returns `data_source_id`)
- `context_window_add_turn` — log a user / assistant / system turn
- `context_window_attach` — resume an archived window by id
- `context_window_close` — close the active window

**Writeback:**
- `ingest` — push durable content into the graph

All retrieval tools are **automatically window-aware** when a window has been created in the session — no id threading needed from the LLM. The server holds one "active" window and uses it implicitly; multi-window callers pass `data_source_id` explicitly.

## Why this, not the direct SDK adapters

- **Zero code.** Config-only integration with every MCP-speaking client.
- **Works with Anthropic's managed stack.** Claude Code, Desktop, Cursor, and Agent SDK all speak MCP natively.
- **Persistent server process.** Unlike the shell-out pattern, `@copass/mcp` holds windows, clients, and sessions in memory across tool calls.

## Environment

| Variable | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `COPASS_API_KEY` | ✅ | — |
| `COPASS_SANDBOX_ID` | ✅ | — |
| `COPASS_API_URL` | — | `https://ai.copass.id` |
| `COPASS_PROJECT_ID` | — | (none) |
| `COPASS_PRESET` | — | `auto` |
| `COPASS_INGEST_DATA_SOURCE_ID` | — | (none — required for `ingest` unless passed per call) |
| `COPASS_CONTEXT_WINDOW_ID` | — | (none — if set, the server auto-attaches to this window on startup and makes it the active window) |
| `COPASS_CONTEXT_WINDOW_INITIAL_TURNS` | — | (none — JSON array of `{role, content}` used to seed the window's turn buffer on startup so retrieval is window-aware from the first tool call) |

### Pre-attaching a Context Window

If a parent process (HTTP server, agent runtime, orchestrator) has already created a Context Window via `@copass/core` and is launching `@copass/mcp` as a subprocess, pass the window's `data_source_id` as `COPASS_CONTEXT_WINDOW_ID` so retrieval is window-aware from the first tool call — no need for the LLM to call `context_window_create` / `context_window_attach` itself.

Since the MCP subprocess is ephemeral (often one per turn), the Context Window's local turn buffer resets on each spawn. To keep retrieval window-aware *across* turns, the parent process should track prior turns and serialize them as JSON into `COPASS_CONTEXT_WINDOW_INITIAL_TURNS` before each spawn:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "copass": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@copass/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "COPASS_API_KEY": "...",
        "COPASS_SANDBOX_ID": "...",
        "COPASS_CONTEXT_WINDOW_ID": "ds_xxx",
        "COPASS_CONTEXT_WINDOW_INITIAL_TURNS": "[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"...\"},{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"...\"}]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is exactly how the `create-copass-agent` scaffold wires subprocess-per-turn: the Hono server maintains a `Map<threadId, ChatMessage[]>` and re-serializes on every spawn.

## Programmatic use

Embedding in your own server? Use the building blocks directly:

```ts
import { buildServer, loadConfig } from '@copass/mcp';
import { CopassClient } from '@copass/core';
import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js';

const config = loadConfig();
const client = new CopassClient({ auth: { type: 'bearer', token: config.api_key } });
const server = buildServer({ client, config });
await server.connect(new StdioServerTransport());
```
